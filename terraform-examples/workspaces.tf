# Sure! Here's an example of how you can set up Terraform workspaces for development (dev) and production (prod) environments:

### Terraform Configuration

# **main.tf**
# ```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance-${terraform.workspace}"
  }
}
# ```
# 
### Workspace Initialization

# 1. **Initialize Terraform**
#    ```sh
#    terraform init
#    ```

# 2. **Create and switch to the dev workspace**
#    ```sh
#    terraform workspace new dev
#    terraform workspace select dev
#    ```

# 3. **Create and switch to the prod workspace**
#    ```sh
#    terraform workspace new prod
#    terraform workspace select prod
#    ```

### Applying Configuration

# 1. **Apply configuration in the dev workspace**
#    ```sh
#    terraform workspace select dev
#    terraform apply
#    ```

# 2. **Apply configuration in the prod workspace**
#    ```sh
#    terraform workspace select prod
#    terraform apply
#    ```

# In this example, the `aws_instance` resource will be tagged with the workspace name, allowing you to differentiate between instances created in the dev and prod environments.

# Feel free to ask if you need more details or have any other questions!



# Got it! You can achieve this by using a conditional expression based on the workspace name. Here's how you can modify your `main.tf` to deploy different instance types in dev and prod:

### Terraform Configuration

# **main.tf**
# ```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = terraform.workspace == "dev" ? "t3.small" : "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance-${terraform.workspace}"
  }
}
# ```

### Workspace Initialization

# 1. **Initialize Terraform**
#    ```sh
#    terraform init
#    ```

# 2. **Create and switch to the dev workspace**
#    ```sh
#    terraform workspace new dev
#    terraform workspace select dev
#    ```

# 3. **Create and switch to the prod workspace**
#    ```sh
#    terraform workspace new prod
#    terraform workspace select prod
#    ```

### Applying Configuration

# 1. **Apply configuration in the dev workspace**
#    ```sh
#    terraform workspace select dev
#    terraform apply
#    ```

# 2. **Apply configuration in the prod workspace**
#    ```sh
#    terraform workspace select prod
#    terraform apply
#    ```

# In this setup, the `instance_type` will be `t3.small` in the dev workspace and `t2.micro` in the prod workspace. This allows you to tailor your infrastructure based on the environment.
